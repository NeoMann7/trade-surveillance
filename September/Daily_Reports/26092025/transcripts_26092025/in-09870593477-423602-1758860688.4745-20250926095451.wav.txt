Client: Hello?
Dealer: Hmm. Hello.
Client: Piyush.
Dealer: Bolie sir.
Client: Ha, Piyush.
Dealer: Ha.
Client: Ha, Rimal here.
Dealer: Bol bhai bol bol.
Client: Ha, arre, I was just calling to ask if we can make a call from here right now?
Dealer: No, my phone is in the locker, my friend.
Client: Achha.
Client: So I was saying, it's available at 3 o'clock, if you want to see it today.
Dealer: No, 3 o'clock is not possible for me anyway.
Dealer: It will be late today, it will be late tonight. Or early tomorrow morning.
Client: No, I mean, there's one at 5 o'clock. If you want to see it, the Bhabhi (sister-in-law/lady) can come directly from Bandra, and you can leave from there. There are 11 available, reach by 9 PM.
Dealer: If you want to go today, today it's not possible to go.
Dealer: Because I will just leave from here and go home, finish everything.
Client: No, you don't need to. Just tell him everything from here over the phone. So he can keep it ready and come directly to Bandra by auto.
Client: You can reach Bandra directly.
Client: There's a great train at 5 o'clock. You'll reach Surat by 9 o'clock. You'll get tonight to use, that's why I told you.
Dealer: From where?
Client: It's available. There are 11 tickets for Bandra.
Client: Book it now and talk.
Client: Bhabhi will pack everything and bring all your stuff directly there.
Client: Bandra. She can take an auto and come directly from Bandra. No need to for her to stay there. And for you, both lines are connected from your place.
Client: You can directly reach Bandra from the office, leave at 4 o'clock, and be at Bandra by 4:30.
Client: A 5 o'clock train.
Dealer: Hmm, okay, let me think about it.
Client: There are 10 tickets.
Client: Are you going?
Dealer: No, I won't go, Rimal. I have so much to do right now, everything is just...
Client: Understood.
Dealer: Okay, let me think about it.
Client: But I'm telling you, go. If you want to, don't go tomorrow.
Client: Because why go for one day?
Client: You'll get two days, right? Today is Friday and Saturday.
Dealer: Hmm.
Client: And if there's no exam on Monday, then you can go on Monday too, taking your books.
Dealer: No, I'll have to ask my sister-in-law first, if she has an exam or not, I'll check first.
Client: Yeah, and even if it's on Monday, go today only, I would say. Because if you reach by 10 o'clock, you'll get to enjoy today.
Client: And the ticket is very good, very comfortable ticket, a 5 o'clock ticket.
Dealer: Hmm.
Dealer: Hmm.
Client: Okay, give me five minutes.
Dealer: Okay.
Client: And have you seen the new Jalebi?
Client: Jalebi 3?
Dealer: No, Rimal, I haven't seen anything right now. Where's the time? I don't get any time.
Client: Okay, fine.
Dealer: Okay, bye bye.
Client: Bye.
