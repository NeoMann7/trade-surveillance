Dealer: Yes, ji kya hua sir?
Client: Arathy is not receiving my call. The thing is that I cannot take the confirmation from this conference call. I have to call him or he needs to call me on my landline. So if you can just provide him this number, it will be great so that I can take the confirmation as soon as possible.
Dealer: kitne baje settle ho raha hai kya?
Client: Uh, sorry?
Dealer: Settlement kitne baje hone wala hai trade?
Client: Uhm, ye toh abhi ho jayega na?
Dealer: Ha, ek minute I'll just get him on the phone. Yeah, yeah. Okay.
