Client: (Ringing sound) Man, I know. Yes, sir. I'll take a look. My UPI, yeah, that will allow me to enter. Hello? Hello, sir. Vicky.
Dealer: Hello, hello sir Vicky.
Client: Yeah, I'll go to the law. But it's an invalid. It's an invalid.
Dealer: What's that, sir?
Client: Your UPI ID we entered, no?
Dealer: Uh-huh. That's it. It's invalid. Dash ICICI.
Client: ICICI?
Dealer: Yes. ICICI. Ha, ha. @OK ICICI. This Edelweiss, that UPI ID has been there. Sorry. So, I'm getting a rejection. Can you send me something back on email, sir? Maybe something went wrong when I typed it, or something. Just send me.
Client: I did that UPI ID, and I got approval for Edelweiss.
Dealer: Ha, ha. Okay. So, just send this to me on email once.
Client: I'll send it to you.
Dealer: Whatever your UPI ID is, please forward it to me on email. I'll get it done.
Client: Okay.
Dealer: Right? I just need the UPI ID. You have my email, right, sir? I send a confirmation every day.
Client: If you send me a confirmation, I'll reply to that.
Dealer: Okay, sir. Okay.
