Dealer: Hello.
Client: Hello. Ah.
Dealer: Hmm.
Client: That means you have to pay me cash.
Dealer: What? 180 rupees is minus, so it means cash should be available.
Client: What do you mean? What is that?
Dealer: I'm saying.
Client: You have to pay 230 rupees.
Dealer: No. 6-7 lakh rupees should be there. Early pay has not been done. It has been done for early pay. So, 80 rupees, the rest of the second is not early pay.
Client: What are you saying? Say the truth. Correctly.
Dealer: I have kept it for early pay. I haven't got the limit yet. And the other stock is 80-3200 something, right? Electro-cast. It doesn't show early pay.
Dealer: It doesn't show early pay to me.
Client: Show me.
Dealer: 7 lakh rupees transfer.
Client: I don't have that much cash right now.
Dealer: So how much do you have?
Client: What do you mean? If you can't take it, then call me later.
Dealer: Okay. Now, you are saying that it can be taken in CNC.
Client: Can it be taken in CNC?
Dealer: Margin. Margin.
Client: Yes. 200 rupees you said. Yes.
Dealer: Which is short. Now you quickly do one thing. If you do early pay, then take it.
Client: I'll try to do early pay. What are you saying?
Dealer: Yes, yes. But early pay, early pay. 24000.
Client: Okay. What's the next track?
Dealer: Tell me. Now it's clear.
Client: Hello. What's going on? Now it's coming, right? Hello.
Dealer: Now speak.
Client: I have kept 24000 shares in early pay. If I see a cash limit, I will start buying.
Dealer: Yes, start it. Start it.
Client: If it doesn't show in cash. What is this early pay problem?
Dealer: No, no. I have kept it for early pay. I don't see it yet.
Client: It should be there.
Dealer: Early pay, you have to try. Put it again if you want.
Client: Yes, put it. It will be done.
Dealer: Yes, I'm trying. Otherwise, when will you come online again?
Client: I will be online at 11 AM.
