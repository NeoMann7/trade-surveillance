Client: Hello?
Dealer: Hello.
Client: Yeah, I am waiting for it, because payment transfer is ₹36 lakh, but still it's not visible.
Dealer: ₹36 lakh?
Client: Ha, ha, it is. PNB.
Dealer: PNB.
Client: I mean, it's not my account. He just told me that he transferred to PNB, but I don't know, he's saying RTGS is done.
Dealer: No, no, no, which account? Which account he told me? I am asking that.
Client: Maybe he did from PNB, maybe.
Dealer: One minute.
Dealer: It will take some time, what is there?
Client: Ha, ha.
Dealer: You sent a receipt, but they did it from PNB to your HDFC.
Dealer: No, it's not visible to me.
Client: I told him to send the receipt.
Dealer: Receipt is there, but how will we know that? Banking operations, did you mail them?
Client: How much time does it generally take for RTGS?
Dealer: It should have come by now, it should be fine.
Client: So, should I forward this receipt to him?
Dealer: Yes, forward it to banking operations.
Client: Okay.
Dealer: Is it okay?
Client: Banking ops. Okay. Only banking ops?
Dealer: Ha, ha.
Client: Okay.
Dealer: Ha.
Client: Okay.
