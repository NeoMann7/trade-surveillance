Speaker 1: So please join me in welcoming the Chairman and Managing Director of Neo Group, Mr. Nitin Jain.
Speaker 2: Thank you so much, Shiro.
Speaker 1: A very warm welcome.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: I'll start with a very basic, basic question. When we hear these terms asset management and wealth management, thoda confusing sa lagta hai. Ki wealth is getting managed, and what's actually the difference between asset management and wealth management?
Speaker 2: Actually, bahut hi interesting question hai. Because I have seen so many people in the industry also sometimes being confused about wealth and asset management. So thank you for asking. Uh, aap mutual funds dekhte hain, right? So if you think about mutual fund, mutual fund is a business, it's an asset management business. Ab ek fund manager hai, agar aap usse dekhen, toh woh bahut saare paise manage kar raha hai. But usko yeh nahi pata hai ki uske clients kaun hain.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Kisi ne ₹500 invest kiye hain, uski age 25 saal hai. Kisi ne 50 crore invest kiye hain, uski age 50 saal hai. Lekin fund manager ka focus kya hai? Yeh jo paise hain iska return index se better hona chahiye, hai na? Toh agar positive 10% index ne diya, toh he is trying his best to deliver 11. But agar minus 40 diya, toh he is saying ki main minus 38 karunga.
Speaker 1: Mutual fund manager.
Speaker 2: Mutual fund manager, hai na?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Ab as a client, will you be happy with that number? Of course not. Right? Toh wealth manager ki zimmedaari hai ki woh is tarah se aapke portfolio ko banaye ki thoda paisa equity mein, thoda paisa fixed income mein, thoda credit mein, thoda alternates mein, jis tarah se bhi. Lekin he's trying to solve for bespoke needs of a client. He, he's like a doctor. Agar aap ek, perfect example nahi hai, but reasonable hai samajhne ke liye. Toh aap wealth manager ko dekhte hain, toh aap samjhiye woh advice de raha hai. Manufacturing jo hai, jaise usme pharmacist jo hai, woh asset manager. Woh manufacture kar rahe hain products ko.
Speaker 1: Dawaai jaise manufacture kar.
Speaker 2: Haan. Dawaai jaise aap manufacture kar rahe hain, yeh hai asset management. Aur jo doctor hai jo advice de raha hai, woh wealth management hai.
Speaker 1: Bahut achha example diya aapne. So, yeh jo wealth management, wealth managers are the ones who work with family officers and then the wealthy people, and then diversify the assets, kahaan kahaan invest karna hai. Correct. Woh bataenge. Abhi wealthy clients ki baat agar karte hain, normally hum sochte hain, toh we think of celebrities, ya promoters of large listed companies jinhone itna paisa banaya hai. Where do they invest their money? Because normal investor ke perspective se dekhenge toh fixed deposits hai, stocks hai, mutual funds hai. Do they have a different category of investments altogether that they invest in? How are they different?
Speaker 2: See, ek cheez jo aap, I'm sure it's very intuitive ki jin logon ke paas 50 crore hai, 100 crore hai, ya kayi baar 1000 crore hain, 10 crore hai, plus, aap samajh lijiye. Aur cash flows bhi theek thak hain. Toh unki life mein safety cushion ki zaroorat kam hai. Correct. Hai na? Toh unki risk appetite zyada hai. Toh unka jo main ambition hai, woh hai growth. Hmm. They are trying to grow their capital. Jabki jab aap paise kama rahe hote hain aur aap us stage tak nahi pahunche hain, tab tak aapko chahiye hai protection. Right. Toh isliye jo yeh clients, jinki aap baat kar rahe hain, hum baat kar rahe hain, zyadaatar unka focus growth pe hota hai. Toh aap dekhenge unke portfolios mein actually mein FD vagaira bahut kam honge agar honge bhi toh, most clients that we manage hardly they would have fixed deposits as a core part of the portfolio. They might have some low risk, high rated bonds in the portfolio. But outside of that, unke zyadaatar asset allocation mein aap samjh lijiye ek ho gaya safety bucket jo chhota sa hai, jismein aap is tarah ke assets hain. Dusra hota hai ek growth capital. Growth capital matlab ki jahaan pe aap paisa, aap samjh lein mota mota paanch saal mein double kare. Toh 13-14% ki growth. Usmein zyadaatar equities, mutual funds, direct, uh, bonds, etcetera, yeh pura portfolio hota hai. Aur ek 25-30-40% portfolio jo hai, woh hum log jisko bolte hain alpha portfolio.
Speaker 1: Achha.
Speaker 2: Uh, usme aap koshish kar rahe hain alternates. Ab private equity ho gaya, private credit ho gaya, hedge funds ho gaya, real assets ho gaya. Aajkal invits aur reads aap dekh rahe hain, woh bhi bade part of the portfolio ho gaye hain. Yahaan pe aap koshish kar rahe hain usse thoda sa zyada return, maybe 16, 17% kamaane ki. Toh pehle do buckets mein toh main dekhta hoon zyadaatar log hain.
Speaker 1: Haan.
Speaker 2: But agar aap teesri bucket ki jo aap baat karenge, usse bahut, unless the client is above 10 CR, kam participation dekhne ko milta hai.
Speaker 1: Toh woh ek tarike se high risk, high return wala bucket keh sakte hain usko?
Speaker 2: That is true. Haalanki koshish, jitne bhi alternate products ki hai, woh yeh hai ki kam risk leke zyada return banana. Achha. Toh generally aap kaise sochte hain ki agar risk badh raha hai, toh return badh raha hai? But hamesha aisa nahi hota hai. Toh hedge funds, ya fir, uh, private credit, ya fir private equity, inka objective function hai ki volatility ko thoda kam karke, can you increase the returns? Toh uske liye specialized skills chahiye. Right. Toh uske liye fund managers jo bahut hi kaabil aur bahut hi competent hain, woh log yeh strategies run karte hain. And of course, uh, for which they charge performance fees, etcetera. Bilkul alignment hota hai ki agar aapka achha ho raha hai, toh unka bhi achha hoga. Nahi toh unke paise nahi banenge. Toh yeh, I would not necessarily say higher risk, but superior risk adjusted return is a better way to understand it.
Speaker 1: Understood. Yeah, wealth management industry, hum agar dekhenge and compare it to any other industry, let's say an airline industry or a steel industry, wahaan pe mujhe clearly economic impact dikhta hai. But wealth management mein, we are just...
Speaker 2: I, I exactly know where you are heading, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, what's the productive impact to an economy by this sector?
Speaker 2: Now, main aapko ek chhoti si story batata hoon. Bahut hi personal hai, but, so meri mother, actually meri wife jo hain woh doctor hain. Aur maine bhi IIT se, IIM se padhaai ki hai, toh meri mother obviously has very high expectations of me. But we are from a very traditional family. Toh unko na jab main stock market mein hota hoon, toh unko aisa lagta hai ki jaise main gambling kar raha hoon.
Speaker 1: (laughs)
Speaker 2: Toh woh mere se bahut baar unhone bola, shuru mein, ab toh shayad I think she has understood. Ki beta, aap bahu ko dekhen. Woh doctor hain.
Speaker 1: Jaan bacha rahi hai.
Speaker 2: Jaan bachaati hai logon ke liye itna kuch karti hai. Aur aap kya karte hain? Aapne toh itni achhi padhaai ki, aap kuch nahi kar sakte.
Speaker 1: (laughs)
Speaker 2: Toh maine unko answer diya, uss waqt woh ek hospital mein kaam karti thi, and maine unko bola ki dekhiye, woh doctor hai, lekin jo hospital bana na, unke jo promoter hain, unko yeh hospital banane ke liye paisa maine raise karke diya.
Speaker 1: Kya baat hai.
Speaker 2: Toh shayad yeh thoda sa misunderstood segment hai. Mujhe lagta hai ki wealth management, humara main purpose pata hai kya? Savings ko India ki channelize karna towards productive assets. Hmm. Isse bada job impact ya productivity impact, ya GDP impact, aur kaun sa sector kar sakta hai? Toh kayi baar hum log direct, uh, impact nahi samajh paate hain, but agar India ko grow karna hai, toh mujhe lagta hai uski jo sabse badi zaroorat hai, woh hai risk capital. Promoters, kyunki India mein entrepreneurs ki kami nahi hai, kaabil logon ki kami nahi hai. But unhe business shuru karna hai, uske liye paise kahaan se aayenge? Ya business ko badhaana hai, uske liye paise kahaan se aayenge? Toh a lot of these families, uh, institutions are allocating capital to these productive sectors of the economy, and we are the channel through which this money is getting directed in those places.
Speaker 1: Toh aapne ek baat boli, risk capital. So, is that capital where people are willing to take a higher risk in the prospect of a higher return?
Speaker 2: Actually, I think I should explain risk capital. Agar aap koi bhi business shuru kar rahe hain, toh do tarah ke paise hote hain. Ek hota hai partnership money. Jismein jo, jisko main risk capital bhi bolta hoon, ki mujhe laga ki Dr. Chiro is exceptional at building a business. But Dr. Chiro currently because he is young, he does not have enough capital to build. So I will say ki I can't do this, but Chiro can do this. So why don't I put money with Chiro, and let him start the business? Whatever is the profit, we will share. Achha. But whatever is the loss also, we will share.
Speaker 1: So lag ke along side.
Speaker 2: Along side aapke kaam kar rahe hain. But Chiro will take this capital and maybe then borrow money from a bank. And then build his plant. Okay? Lekin bank tab tak aapko paisa nahi de sakta jab tak ki aapke paas original risk capital nahi hai.
Speaker 1: First check is always the most difficult check, yeah.
Speaker 2: And it is not credit. It is equity. Matlab ki agar aapko loss hua na, toh barabar ka hai. Bank ke saath jo aapne paisa liya na, agar aapko loss hua, toh aapko toh bank ko chukaana hai. Correct. Toh yeh paisa jo hai, yahi entrepreneur ki energy hai. Agar business banaana hai na, toh aapko risk capital chahiye. Aur India mein agar aap dekhen, toh sabse badi kami hai risk capital ki. Qaabiliyat ki kami nahi hai. Aur mujhe lagta hai, India ko agar sach mein grow karna hai, toh bahut risk capital ki zaroorat hai. Silicon Valley ko dekhiye. Ek chhota sa entrepreneur, 20 saal ka, 21 saal ka, usko business shuru karne ka man hai, ek achha idea hai, achhi team shuru ki hai. Tons and tons of money is available. With its own guard rails, everything. Lekin paisa available hai. India mein woh nahi hai. Thoda bahut hai, agar aap bolein toh Bangalore mein woh thoda sa Silicon Valley kehte hain usko.
Speaker 1: Bangalore.
Speaker 2: But bahut chhota hai. Hum logon ko Indian economy ko agar sach mein grow karna hai, the single biggest factor you should focus on is risk capital. You get that right, everything will fall in place. Toh hum log koshish kar rahe hain apni taraf se uss direction mein capital ko channelize karne ki, chahe woh private equity ho, chahe woh venture capital ho, chahe woh private credit ho, hedge funds. A lot of these strategies are promoting job creation in that sense.
Speaker 1: That's a lot of benefit to the economy and then productive use.
Speaker 2: Of course.
Speaker 1: Aap 25 saal se is industry mein hain. From 2000 to 2025, yadi aap dekhenge, a lot of startups have also started and then we have seen them becoming very large companies. Saath mein wealth management industry also has grown in proportion.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So what are some of the trends that you have seen and where are we headed?
Speaker 2: In the wealth management industry.
Speaker 1: Yes, in the wealth management industry.
Speaker 2: So, jab maine yeh career shuru kiya tha wealth management mein, main baat kar raha hoon 2007-08 us time ki. Uss time pe, abhi bhi hum log ka per capita agar aap dekhen India mein kitna hoga?
Speaker 1: $3000.
Speaker 2: $3000. Uss waqt, if I'm not mistaken, $1000 se below tha. Toh India had not seen wealth creation, right? Toh actually it was too young, too early to be in the wealth management business. Toh zyadaatar uss waqt jo aap dekhen banks the, jo private banks, public sector banks, woh wealth management ka ek format run kar rahe the, which I think was largely financial product distribution. Toh aap mutual fund bech rahe hain, aur insurance bech rahe hain. These were the two core products jo aap...
Speaker 1: Correct.
Speaker 2: But advisory nahi tha. Matlab ab yeh samajhne ki koshish nahi kar rahe the client ka 15 saal, 20 saal, 25 saal ka end goal kya hai, IPS uske hisaab se planning, yeh sab nahi tha. It was purely, mere paas yeh achha product hai, main clients dhoondh raha hoon unko bechne ke liye. But I think 2010, 9, 10, 11, 12, teen char company shuru hui jinhone us period mein bahut achha kaam kiya. Numama ho gaya, uh, 361 ho gaya. Uh, ASK ho gaya. Uh, aur aise kayi saare log, teen char log aur jinhone achhe businesses banaaye aur industry ko sikhaya ki yeh business... Mujhe yaad hai uss time pe 2010-11 mein jab main client se milta tha, a lot of these rich people, promoters and all. Un logon se jab hum baat karte the na, stock market ke baare mein, this is price to equity, uh, price, P2E, this is price to book. Yeh ROI hai, yeh CAGR hai.
Speaker 1: That's scary terms saare ek saath.
Speaker 2: This is very. Toh unko na bahut shock lagta tha. Yeh kya baatein ho rahi hain? Because unhone zyadaatar paisa apna ya toh gold mein invest kiya tha, ya real estate mein invest kiya tha, ya fir FDs mein rakha hua tha. Toh unke liye toh stock market hi bahut nayi cheez thi.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: Toh they were very, uh, enamoured and you know, the relationship managers were able to add dramatic value because of the differential in knowledge. Right. But ek bahut hi strange cheez hui hai pichhle char paanch saalon mein. Mujhe aisa lagta hai. Ki jo clients ki knowledge yahan thi, woh yahaan pahunch gayi hai.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: Aur jo RMs ki knowledge, maan lijiye yahan, yahan thi shayad. Woh yahan pahunchi hai. Toh ab suddenly RMs are struggling, or advisors are struggling to keep pace with the sophistication level. Aur mujhe lagta hai yeh disruption shuru hua hai, yeh aur accentuate hoga.
Speaker 1: Iska kaaran kya ho sakta hai? Is it technology? Ya fir they have become seasoned investors?
Speaker 2: Actually, uh, dono shayad. Ek toh kya hua, pichhle 15 saal se hum sab log unse baar baar milte hain, toh itni saari paanch paanch company ke log unko jaake sab kuch bol rahe hain, toh seekh rahe hain. Dusra ek jo maine dekha hai, India mein, yeh mera experience hai, shayad sahi, shayad, shayad galat. Maine Indian entrepreneurs ko jab main compare karta hoon duniya bhar ke entrepreneurs, toh mereko aisa lagta hai, rigor aur capability mein na, shayad Indian entrepreneurs, I would rate them very high. Maybe in the, maybe the best or maybe at least in the top five percentile. Toh un logon ki samajh bahut zyada hai. Jaise developed countries mein jo rich families aur promoters hain na, unka kya hota hai ki jab ek baar unhone paise bana liye na, toh they don't want to focus on money. They said ki mera yeh paisa hai, isme mera wealth manager paisa banayega, jo karega. They are now celebrating life.
Speaker 1: Enjoy kar raha hai.
Speaker 2: Enjoying life, ghoom rahe hain, yeh kar rahe hain. India mein aisa nahi hai. Indians are very conservative in that sense. Unke liye paisa bahut maayne rakhta hai. Woh sirf apne baare mein nahi soch rahe hain, apni next generation, uski next generation ke baare mein soch rahe hain. Toh bahut dhyan dete hain. Toh unka seekhne ka man hai, aur sikhaane ke itne saare log hain. Hmm. Aur jo last cheez hai, mujhe lagta hai ki like jaise aapne bola, technology ki wajah se information asymmetry khatam ho gayi hai. Ab knowledge is at your fingertips, especially with AI coming in, ChatGPT. Jo bhi aapko puchhna hai, aap kitne bhi detail mein ChatGPT se pooch sakte hain. Toh opacity jo thi pehle industry ki, ki, uh, jo stock market experts hain, unko jo pata tha, aur jo clients ko pata tha, usme bahut gap tha. Woh gap khatam ho gaya because of this. Hmm. Aur by the way, mujhse lagta hai it is going to dramatically become bigger.
Speaker 1: In the coming years?
Speaker 2: In coming years, and isliye shayad business more than relationship and more than sales will also become more about knowledge. Hmm. And real capability. Toh main apni team se bhi bahut, we are trying our best to compete on knowledge. Aur mujhe aisa lagta hai ki jo bhi industry mein yeh transition nahi karega, shayad unko dikkat hogi.
Speaker 1: Aane wale saal mein.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And AI waise bhi people are saying that once AI comes in full fledged, there'll be a lot of job losses. So wealth management industry mein, how, how is the industry adopting AI? And what will happen to a relationship manager in future? Already we've seen some robo advisors and, uh, tech first wealth advisor.
Speaker 2: Dekhiye, job losses ka toh main nahi keh sakta. Because humanity has a way to evolve. Jab computers aaye, tab bhi yeh darr tha. Internet aaya, tab bhi yeh darr tha. AI ke saamne. Naye tarah ke jobs create honge shayad. Hmm. Productivity levels dramatically improve karenge. But ek bahut hi jo kamaal ki cheez hui hai, aur mere man mein yeh bahut badi ummeed hai. Kyunki hum log young company hain. Mujhe lagta hai pehli baar legacy resources ka jo competitive advantage hai, woh bahut, main samjhaane ki koshish kar raha hoon. Jaise agar aap bade bank hain, toh aapke paas sabse bada resource pata hai kya? Capital. Aapke paas 1 lakh crore cash hai. Ek nayi company hai. Aapka jo saal ka interest hai, usme toh aise 10 companiyan khadi ho jayengi. Aapke paas 3 lakh employees hain. Call center hain jahaan 50,000 log hain. Toh ek nayi company ke liye itni badi company se, particularly in industries like financial services, bahut mushkil hai.
Speaker 1: Ek nayi company khada karna aaj ke time mein, the amount of capital and resources that it requires, let's say a bank. Agar bank chaalu karna hai mujhe.
Speaker 2: Toh agar aapke paas 5-10,000 crore nahi hai, aur kam se kam nahi toh 1000 log nahi hain, tab aap shuru nahi kar sakte.
Speaker 1: Nahi kar sakte.
Speaker 2: Lekin, with AI, in the future. And don't think of AI as a static technology. Mujhe yaad hai woh 1990s, early 1990s, aap log toh shayad paida bhi na hue honge uss... Computers jo the na, itne clunky the.
Speaker 1: Bade bade.
Speaker 2: Bade bade, aur us pe type karna bada mushkil tha. Toh logon ko aisa lagta tha ki isse toh behtar hai likh ke haath se pehle jaldi kar sakte hain. But cheezen badalti hain, technology improve karti hai. AI ka bhi wahi zone chal raha hai. But aap socho, ek call center jismein ek bhi insaan nahi hai. Ek bhi insaan nahi. Sirf agents. Jo thakte nahi hain. Jo aap kitne bhi gusse mein baat karein, woh gusse mein respond nahi karte hain.
Speaker 1: Emotions nahi hote hain, 24 ghante kaam karte hain.
Speaker 2: Haan. Aur aapki samajh ko, aapke problem ko exactly solve karte hain. Because unki knowledge infinite hai. Main 50,000 logon ke call center se compete kar sakta hoon agar mere andar woh qaabiliyat hai ab. Toh fundamentally jo main bol raha hoon ki mujhe lagta hai AI ko agar dhang se istemal karein, toh bahut saari industries disrupt hongi. Aur mujhe lagta hai industries expand karengi. Aise mat sochiye ki yeh industry ka size yeh tha, toh baaki logon ka sirf kam hoga. Mujhe lagta hai yeh multifold jump hoga productivity mein, size mein, scale mein. Aur uska dominant market share will go to companies where AI is at its core.
Speaker 1: Very interesting.
Speaker 2: Hmm.
Speaker 1: Aapne upskilling ki baat kari hai. That's a scary thought, but it's also an opportunity. Aaj agar koi naya entrant wealth management mein aana chahta hai, what is your two piece advice to him? Kya karna chahiye? What can we do right? To prepare for the future.
Speaker 2: See, kisi bhi business mein mere ko lagta hai teen cheezein hoti hain. Uh, especially services business mein. People, culture, and capital. And chauthi cheez shayad main add kar doonga, technology ki understanding. So let's call it T square C square.
Speaker 1: T square C square, okay.
Speaker 2: T square C square, matlab talent, technology, culture, and capital. Talent, technology, culture and capital. Toh agar aapko lagta hai ki aap yeh charon cheezon mein maharat hai aapki, ya aap yeh sab aapki team mein set kar sakte hain, achhe logon ko attract karna. Un logon ko ek saath jod ke kaam karna. That is the culture. Culture kya hai? Ek direction mein jaana aur sab log ek hi taraf zor lagaayein, alignment.
Speaker 1: Alignment.
Speaker 2: Yeh hai aapka culture part. And purpose, matlab ek toh achha purpose bhi hona chahiye na ki agar main jahan ja raha hoon wahan jaane ka man bhi toh hona chahiye.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: Tabhi log jayenge. So giving them a purpose and aligning them in the same direction, I think that is the, uh, culture part. And adequate resources. Now, I do think, with very small resources, wealth management cannot be done. It is a game of technology, it is a game of people, it is a game of capability. The entry barriers have gone up. So I highly advise people, if you really want to start a business, think about raising a lot of capital before you get in. Otherwise, a boutique advisory firm can be set. A wealth, I think it's a, now it's a very regulated, very compliant, very strong entry barrier business. So you need a lot of all these four things.
Speaker 1: And for students who are aspiring to prepare for the wealth management industry?
Speaker 2: Okay, so I heard your question earlier as people who are wanting to be, uh, wealth management businesses, but so let me correct myself. Invest a lot in two things: finance and AI. Ab aapki knowledge, it's not adequate. It's very critical to understand valuations, to understand investing, to understand behavioral finance, and the core rigours of finance, right? Everything related with finance. It's, it's critical. Because knowledge levels have to be much higher, like I was saying, the sophistication levels. And having a global perspective. I think it's equally important now. You can't just think local. Hmm. Having a global perspective is important. So read a lot about the global economy, because all of them are so now interlinked.
Speaker 1: Interlinked.
Speaker 2: But the second equally important, and I think this is where a lot of youngsters are making a mistake. You have to be terribly good at AI. There is no game. Trust me, if you are not upping your game on AI, you are out. Five years, 10 years down, you have no chance of being a successful finance professional. It's not on the table.
Speaker 1: Excellent. Thank you so much, Nitin, for your thoughts. And I think our viewers are going to take back some very valuable insights from the discussion we had today.
Speaker 2: Oh, it's such a pleasure, Dr. Chiro. Always, always. Thank you.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: Done?
Speaker 1: Done.
Speaker 2: Perfect. Thoda sa dekh sakte hain?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Hmm.
