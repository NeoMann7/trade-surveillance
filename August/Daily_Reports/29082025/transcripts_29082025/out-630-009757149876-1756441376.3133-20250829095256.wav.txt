Dealer: Halo?
Client: Halo?
Dealer: Ha.
Client: Uh, yeah, uh, Rajit, uh, this is Jignasha from Neoville.
Dealer: Okay.
Client: Um, actually, you have sent a mail for, uh, Mr. Arnav's trade, right?
Dealer: Yes, yes, yes. I guess, I guess it's short of funds now, right now.
Client: Uh, okay, so that is there, but I also want you to check with the format which we actually shared because that is a compliance-based format. So if you can,
Dealer: Okay, okay.
Client: Yeah, if you can please
Dealer: So, listen, listen, can you speak to Preeti on this? Okay, I'm out for a function. I've taken an off today. Okay, can you speak to Preeti? She'll arrange it for you.
Client: Okay, okay, fine.
Dealer: And with respect to funds, okay, I'll just check. Do you have the funds or not? It's short of funds. My understanding is it should be short of funds, isn't it?
Client: No, no. While placing the order, if there's a short of funds, I'll, I'll, you know, update you on the same. But we need to fix with the approval on the format-based mail.
Dealer: Perfect, perfect. Just write to Preeti, she'll just, you know, send the perfect format for you. She'll just, yeah.
Client: Okay, sure.
Dealer: Thank you, thank you.
Client: Thank you, thank you.
